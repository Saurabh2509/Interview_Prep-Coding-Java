<h1>Problem_Statement:</h1>

<h3>Problem Description:</h3> 
You are given an array A[] with n elements. You need to find the maximum sum of a subarray among all subarrays of that array.

<h4>Some properties of this problem are:</h4>

-If the array contains all non-negative numbers, the maximum subarray is the entire array.

-Several different sub-arrays may have the same maximum sum.

<h3>Input/Output</h3>

Input: A[] = {-5, 8, 9, -6, 10, -15, 3}

Output: 21, the subarray {8, 9, -6, 10} has the maximum sum among all subarrays

Input: A[] = { -4, -7, -1, 5,-2}

Output: 4, the subarray {-1, 5} has the maximum sum
